# ohr

ohr is a decentralized application (dApp) that enables users to record and upload audio recordings to the Solana blockchain, providing a secure and immutable record of special moments in their lives. After recording a sound, a music visualization is created and then minted on chain as an NFT.

## How it works

To use ohr, simply record an audio clip using your device's microphone or audio recording software, and upload it to the ohr dApp. The audio clip is then processed to create a unique music visualization, which is minted as an NFT on the Solana blockchain along with the audio recording. This provides proof of ownership and authenticity of the recording and its corresponding visualization.

Each audio NFT and its corresponding visualization are unique and can be bought, sold, or traded on the Solana blockchain. This provides a new way for collectors, music enthusiasts, and anyone interested in unique and rare digital assets to own and share special audio recordings and their visualizations.

## Installation

To use ohr, you will need to have access to a compatible web3 wallet, such as Sollet or Phantom, and have SOL tokens available for gas fees. Once you have a compatible wallet and SOL tokens, you can visit the ohr dApp and start recording and uploading audio clips.

## Development

ohr is built on the Solana blockchain using Rust and the Solana Web3.js library. The dApp is open-source, and contributions and feedback from the community are welcome. If you are interested in contributing to ohr, please see our GitHub repository for more information.

## Legal considerations

It is important to note that copyright and ownership laws can vary by jurisdiction, and it may be necessary to seek legal advice to ensure compliance with local laws and regulations. ohr is not responsible for any legal issues that may arise from the use of the dApp.
